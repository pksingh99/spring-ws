# Spring Web Services
Spring Web Services is a product of the Spring community focused on creating
document-driven Web services. Spring Web Services aims to facilitate
contract-first SOAP service development, allowing for the creation of flexible
web services using one of the many ways to manipulate XML payloads.

## Building from Source

Spring Web Services uses a [Gradle](http://gradle.org)-based build system. In
the instructions below, [`./gradlew`](http://vimeo.com/34436402) is invoked
from the root of the source tree and serves as a cross-platform, self-contained
bootstrap mechanism for the build. The only prerequisites are
[Git](http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect) and JDK 1.7+.

### check out sources
`git clone git://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ws.git`

### compile and test, build all jars, distribution zips and docs
`./gradlew build`

### install all spring-\* jars into your local Maven cache
`./gradlew install`

... and discover more commands with `./gradlew tasks`. See also the [Gradle build and release FAQ](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Gradle-build-and-release-FAQ).
